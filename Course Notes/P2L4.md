# P2L4: Thread Design Considerations

## Recall: Kernel-level threads vs. User-level threads

### Kernel-level threads

Support of kernel-level threads means that the OS itself is multi-threaded. To do this, the OS kernel maintains

- scheduling
- sync, etc.

### User-level threads

Support of user-level threads means that there exists a user-level library that provides all of the management in the runtime support for threads.
